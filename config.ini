; Authors: Jake Bradford, Timothy Chappell, Dimitri Perrin


[general]
; Provide an identifier for this configuration. Crackling will use it to 
; prefix file names.
name = sample

; Indicate which level of optimisations that you wish to use.
; Options are:
;	- ultralow	Assess everything.
;
;	- low: 		All efficiency and specificity results are calculated for those
;				guides detected as unique via the initial regex test.
;
;	- medium: 	All efficiency and specificity results are calculated for those
;				guides detected as unique via the initial regex test.
;				Specificity is only assessed for efficient guides.	
;	
;	- high:		Minimal results are calculated.

; Default: high
optimisation = high


[consensus]
; How many methods need to agree to deem that a guide is efficient?
; Ensure that this value is less than or equal to the number of methods
; that you enable below.
; Default: 2;
n = 2

; Enable/disable methods below. Use True or False.
; Default: True, True, True

[input]
; The input sequences to analyse.
; This is parsed using glob. 
; https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
; You can provide
;	- A filename
; 	- A directory
;	- A path using wildcards
exon-sequences = /sample/scaffolds/

; The ISSL index
offtarget-sites = /sample/offtargetSites.txt

; A GFF annotation for the input genome
; This is used as in an optional post-processing step.
gff-annotation = /sample.gff

; A Bowtie2 index for the input genome
bowtie2-index = /sample/sample.fa

; Batch size to split the input file.
; Extracting the initial list of guides can quickly exhaust the available memory.
; To address this issues we process the guides in batches.
; Default = 5000000; (5 million)
batch-size = 5000000


[output]
; A directory to write output, and temporary, files to. Ensure this dir exists.
dir = ./sample-output/

; The default name for the final results file. 
; This is prefixed with the name specified in General.
; Default: guides.txt

; The delimiter to use in the results file.
; Default: ,

; ISSL executable path
; Default: ./isslScoreOfftargets

; Which scoring method to use?
; Options: mit, cfd, and, or, avg
; mit - Fail when MIT drops below score-threshold
; cfd - Fail when CFD drops below score-threshold
; and - Fail when CFD and MIT drops below score-threshold
; or  - Fail when CFD or MIT drops below score-threshold
; avg - Fail when the average of CFD and MIT drops below score-threshold

; ISSL can consume a large volume of memory when processing millions of
; sequences. Specify how many guides to assess for each instance of ISSL 
; that we call. Note: we run ISSL in multi-threaded mode but only call one 
; ISSL process at a time.
; Setting this to zero causes all guides to be processed at once.
; Default: 5000000 (5 million)

; The lower-bound threshold for the off-target score. If the score drops below

; Default 4

[sgrnascorer2]
